To all alpha testers:

First of all, thank you very much that you are willing to give MountWizzard4 a try for
testing. I really appreciate this, because the broad base of equipment to be used in
modeling I can't test myself, nor do I own some of this parts.

For those who are already on MountWizzard3:

Please notice that it is a complete rewrite of the package. So there is no real backwards
compatibility for all file formats. As result, please don't mix working directories as
this might result is problems. Please use a new working directory and start from scratch.

There might be the situation, that things change due to your helpful feedback.


For the testing it might be helpful to enable all parts to debug logging level. This should
be the case of an fresh install, but you could have a look to the settings tab / misc to be
sure to log all issues.

If there were any problems, please report them with log file attached. Otherwise I hardly
could figure out, what might happen. The log file is always located in your working directory.
