â€šnecessary feature:
- tooltips

nice to have:
- astrometry online
- hemisphere: show best altitude when polar align is on
- temperature of CCD
- choice which data to be used for refraction update
- polar hemisphere
- improve stretch further
- histogram to image window
- autofocus with FFT
- stack with align
- indi image snooping
- consolidate transformations
- test indibase without server
- Editable 3D telescope view shows the current orientation of your telescope and mount.
- Can save/recall multiple RA/Dec and Alt/Az slew coordinates (Add on to slew)
- Site management allows easily changeable setup for multiple sites.
- Display and change time zone settings.
- Move scope

architecture:
- mainApp refactor to better understandable implementation
- check performance of mount connection
- INDI server alive (otherwise if no disconnect -> status stays green))
