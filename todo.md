problems occurred list:

- mountcontrol overflow pointing
- setting indi cycle time
- tests for model manage
- mountcontrol: tests for all commands available
- tests for polar plot in mainW missing


necessary feature list:

- add dome support from indi
- add dso path calculation in modeldata
- add dso path in mainW
- hemisphere: show best altitude when polar align is on
- link dome to hemisphere
- astrometry online
- astrometry threads
- astrometry configs
- local astrometry: multi platform
- image widget
- indi CCD camera
- indi telescope / dome separate host
- indi CCD camera separate host
- mountcontrol: adding TLE commands and tests
- optimizing model functions (all) implement


nice to have:

- auto reconnect all indi servers
- wcs projection in image to flat
- wcs axes in GUI
- imaging windows astropy stretching
- indi setting parameters of devices
- gui show indi device FL / pixels data in screen and choose which to use
- gui hemisphere partitioning for progress bars (sizable ?)
- check if daylight timezone fits to the computer or set it up !
- check if get Properties needed to be implemented in indibase
